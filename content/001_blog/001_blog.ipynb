    "\n",
    "Semantic search helps you to find similarities among datasets, whether among unstructured text, media, audio or structured data like tabular, log files, etc. Importantly, semantic search can find matching results based on the underlying *meaning* or similarity of data, as opposed to more traditional search based on keyword matches.\n",

    "Some of the top use cases for semantic search are:\n",
    "- Search engines\n",
    "- Recommendation engines\n",
    "- Anomaly detection\n",
    "- Duplicate detection\n",
